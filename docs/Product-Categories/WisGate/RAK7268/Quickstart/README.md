# RAK7268 Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisites

### What Do You Need?

1. [**RAK7268/RAK7268C WisGate Edge Lite 2**](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/wisgate-edge-lite-2-rak7268-rak7268c?utm_source=WisGateRAK7268&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore)
2. [Ethernet Cable](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/ethernet-cable-gland?utm_source=EthernetCableGland&utm_medium=Document&utm_campaign=BuyFromStore) (RJ-45 Port) ‚Äì for Ethernet connection
3. A Windows/MacOS/Linux computer

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
The SIM card slot of the cellular versions is not hot-swappable. Make sure the gateway is switched off before inserting or ejecting the SIM card.
:::

## Product Configuration

### Power on the Gateway

1. Attach the LoRa Antenna.

First and foremost, screw on the antenna to the RP-SMA connector on the back panel of the RAK7268/C WisGate Edge Lite 2.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Do not power the device if the LoRa Antenna port has been left open to avoid potential damage to the RAK7268/RAK7268C WisGate Edge Lite 2.
:::

2. Power the gateway **ON**.

It is recommended to use the **12&nbsp;V DC adapter** that comes with the RAK7268/RAK7268C WisGate Edge Lite 2. Optionally, you can use your own **PoE cable** and **injector** since the device supports PoE.

#### Reset Key Functions

The functions of the **Reset** key are as follows:

1. **Short press** - Restarts the gateway.
2. **Long press (5 seconds and above)** - Restores factory settings.


### Access the Gateway

In this section, several ways of accessing the gateway are provided to have different alternatives for you to choose from depending on the availability of the requirements needed.

:::warning ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Do not power the device if the LoRa Antenna port has been left open to avoid potential damage to the RAK7268/RAK7268C WisGate Edge Lite 2.
:::

#### Wi-Fi AP Mode

By default, the gateway will work in Wi-Fi AP Mode which means that you can find an SSID named **RAK7268_XXXX** on your PC's Wi-Fi Network List. **XXXX** is the last two bytes of the gateway's MAC address.

:::tip üìù NOTE:
 No password is required to connect via Wi-Fi
:::

Using your preferred Web browser, log in with the credentials provided below:

- **Browser Address**: 192.168.230.1
- **Username**: root
- **Password**: root

#### WAN Port (Ethernet)

Connect the Ethernet cable to the port marked ETH on the gateway and the other end to the PoE port of the PoE injector. Connect the LAN port of the PoE injector to your PC.

The default IP is **169.254.X.X.** The last two segments (X.X) are mapped from the last four bits of the MAC address of your gateway.

For example, the last four bits of the MAC address are 0F:01, and the IP address is 169.254.15.1. Make sure to manually set the address of your PC to one in the same network (for example 169.254.15.100). Use the same credentials for the Web UI as for AP mode.

### Access the Internet

#### Connect through Wi-Fi

:::tip üìù NOTE:
After connecting to the WiFi network, the gateway's IP address will change, so don't forget to save the EUI ID you need for the next step. [LoRa Network -> LoRaWAN Network Settings> Gateway EUI] Otherwise, since the IP address of the WiFi gateway will change after connecting to WiFi, it will take time to reach the root menu.
:::

Go into the **Network>Wi-Fi** menu and make sure to select **Client** in the **Mode** field. Enter or click "**Scan**" to choose your **ESSID**, select the right **Encryption** method and enter the correct **Key**.

/>

:::tip üìù NOTE:
Assuming you have entered the correct parameter values you should get an IP address assigned by your Wi-Fi router's (AP) built-in DHCP server. You can use this new IP address to log in via a web browser (same way as in AP mode).
:::

#### Connect through Ethernet

Connect the one end of the Ethernet cable to the Ethernet on the Gateway and the other end to your router. The router‚Äôs DHCP server should assign an IP Address to the Gateway. You can change the default settings below if you wish (Full details in the [WisGateOS User Manual](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Software-APIs-and-Libraries/WisGateOS/Overview/#overview)).
